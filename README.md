## Overview

The project uses wildfire data from 2006 to 2023 to:
- Analyze trends in wildfire occurrences.
- Identify clusters of similar wildfire events using k-means clustering.
- Apply frequent pattern mining (FP-Growth) to find patterns in the dataset.
- Perform statistical tests to validate findings.

Technologies: Python, machine learning, statistical analysis.

## Features

- **Frequent Pattern Mining**: Uses the FP-Growth algorithm to discover patterns in the wildfire dataset.
- **Clustering**: Implements k-means clustering for trend analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Includes z-tests and silhouette scoring for validation and optimization.
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Supports preprocessing wildfire data for analysis.
